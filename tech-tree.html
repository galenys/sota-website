                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>The Society for Technological Advancement (SoTA) is hosting its second event on the 1st and 2nd of
                    June
                    2024. This time it is a 'hackathon' which aims to lionise the undiscovered and overlooked pathways
                    of
                    various technoscientific disciplines. We hope to bring together talented, ambitious, rigorous, and
                    enthusiastic individuals for two days of creation. </p>
                <p>Our motivation for doing so is to encourage
                    innovators to explore and maximise the variance of technologies which are available, big or small.
                    This
                    will avoid the dangers that over-specialisation in specific technologies, such as fossil fuels,
                    posed to
                    human flourishing.</p>

                <h2>The Tech Tree</h2>
                <p>The 'tech tree' is a metaphor for the branching paths of progress throughout human history - a
                    concept
                    popularised by video games, where players might unlock 'steel-making' before advancing to 'steam
                    engines'. The branching paths of progress often come with an opportunity cost, meaning that progress
                    down a presently lucrative path may accelerate at the expense of others.
                </p>
                <p>This is over-specialisation, manifesting as a single-point failure when the technology has
                    significant
                    downsides that were not clear upon adoption.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>Historically, human welfare has almost always been a zero-sum game. But every once in a while, things
                    have got radically better, permanently, for everyone. These step changes in the human condition are
                    synonymous with technology. The invention of fire, the wheel, electricity, and of the personal
                    computer
                    changed the world forever and for the better.</p>
                <p>While improving existing paths is vital, in uncertain environments it is better to search broadly
                    than to
                    follow the direct path. Like Lichtenberg figures, finding the optimal path is often not without its
                    branches and diversions.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Your Role</h2>
                <p>Sometimes it can feel like everything has already been discovered. There are no foreign shores in a
                    world
                    with satellite technology. But we believe that our exploration of the tech tree has only just begun.
                </p>
                <p>There are branches of progress that have been either forgotten or intentionally overlooked. Analogue
                    computers and electric cars both preceded their modern counterparts, yet revisiting them reveals
                    untapped potential. We've become highly specialised in fruitful industries like fossil fuels and
                    photolithography, but have left valuable ideas unexplored.
                </p>
                <p>We think the world would be a better place if more people took it upon themselves to be not just
                    passive
                    consumers, but explorers and creators.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">That's where you come in.</p>
