            <section>
                <h2>Why Now</h2>
                <p>Techno-scientific progress encounters a number of barriers in the UK, including excessive
                    bureaucracy, the
                    celebration of prestige over potential, and general pessimism about our ability to positively shape
                    the
                    future
                    through cycles of discovery, invention, and innovation. </p>
                <p>The Society for Technological Advancement (SOTA) is
                    a new venture designed to cultivate optimism about techno-scientific development and build
                    capability for it
                    to
                    happen,
                    forming a cross-disciplinary community around this mission.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p class="bold">Redirect exceptional talent towards technological and scientific pursuits.</p>
                        <p>We believe more of the world's most talented people should be working on problems that
                            actually
                            matter, rather than chasing the latest trend.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="bold">Increase talent density in the UK by building a community of promising
                            scientists and
                            technologists.</p>
                        <p>We want the people building the future to know each other, so that they can build it
                            together.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="bold">Shift public perception toward viewing technology as a vital driver of human
                            progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>We think the world needs a reminder of how far we've come, and a vision of where we could go
                            next.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="bold">The best way to predict the future is to create it.</p>
                        <p>Our future is a direct consequence of our actions. We strive for impact through agency, high
                            conviction
                            and industriousness.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="bold">Technology is the extension of human creative intelligent output.</p>
                        <p>We value technological progress in its variety as a means to overcome challenges, transcend
                            constraints, and improve our chances of surviving external selection pressures.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="bold">Technology is key to human fulfilment.</p>
                        <p>We believe fulfilment can be achieved by building and contributing towards techno-scientific
                            progress
                            which benefits us and the whole species.</p>

                    <li>

                        <p>Our positive attitude towards technology and our ability to use it for good is the best way
                            to
                            overcome
                            those who want to use it for evil.</p>

                <h2>Our Plans</h2>
                <p>Science and technology have been promoted and divulged in increasingly hierarchical, siloed and
                    secluded
                    ways. Taking inspiration from the past while keeping an eye on the future, below are SOTAâ€™s planned
                    activities.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p class="bold">SoTA Fellowships</p>
                        <p>Exceptionally promising young talent will be supported in their work through a close network
                            of peers
                            and
                            a
                            lasting community, along with funding for ambitious projects outside of their comfort zone.

                        <p class="bold">Lectures</p>
                        <p>We will host talks from individuals with unexpected, insightful, and inspiring ideas about
                            solving
                            our
                            current
                            challenges
                            while striving towards the future. These lectures aim to concentrate talent in one space and
                            enable
                            networking
                            and intellectual cross-pollination.</p>

                            educate
                            and

                            These
                            events
                            aim
                            to promote action beyond reflection and ideas, as well as an opportunity for talent to prove
                            itself.
